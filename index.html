            <p>My name is Frank Flores. I got my Associates in Computer Science with an emphasis on programming in 2018. I currently work as a field technician troubleshooting desktops, laptops, servers, switches, routers, etc. as well as work with cabling and cable management. Before that I worked for Trader Joe's for 10+ years and really enjoyed it, but had the chance to work with computer and network hardware/software and took that plunge.</p>
            <p>Besides school and work, I enjoy rock climbing (indoors or outdoors), grew up skateboarding and although I don't skate much anymore I still watch and get exceited when a new skate video comes out. I live in South Pasadena, CA and love going to concerts/shows. Music has and will always be a big part of my life and who I am.</p>
